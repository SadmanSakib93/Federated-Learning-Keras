# Federated Learning Keras
- Replace your own dataset file as the dataset.csv. 
- Note that, the sample dataset.csv file I used, it has its labels (Y) in the first column named as "label". The 2nd to nth columns are the features (X). You might want to change the code according to your dataset structure to ensure proper feature and label handling

## This is a sample Keras implementation of the Federated Learning (FL) for experimental research simulations and might need further modifications to implement it in real-life scenarios.
